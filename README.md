# GDC Data Transfer Tool (gdc-client)

[Overview of the GDC Data Transfer Tool](https://gdc.cancer.gov/access-data/gdc-data-transfer-tool)

The gdc-client provides several convenience functions over the GDC API which provides general download/upload via HTTPS.

## Building the gdc-client

There is a bash script inside the ./bin directory of this repository named `package` that does most of the heavy lifting for building a single executable file of the gdc-client through PyInstaller. It will attempt to guess your operating system, based on `uname`, and build accordingly.

Building on Windows requires the installation of [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the use of the git-shell that comes bundled with it. This will provide enough Unix-like utility needed to run the bash script in this repository.

### Instructions 

```bash
# The script is currently location-dependant, so navigate to the bin directory.
cd bin
# Then just execute the package script. The result will be a zip file containing your executable.
./package
```

## Executing unit tests

First install the Python package from source locally

```bash
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

Run tests
- `python -m pytest tests/`

Run tests with coverage:
- `python -m pytest --cov=gdc_client --cov-branch --cov-report term tests/`

## Install `pre-commit`

This repository makes use of `pre-commit` for code formatting and secrets 
detecting.
In order to make use of it, run the following command:
```
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
pre-commit install
```

Note: This requires your dev environment to have Python 3.8 or higher. 

### Update secrets baseline for `detect-secrets`

We use [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) to search for secrets being committed into the repo.

To update the .secrets.baseline file run
```
detect-secrets scan --update .secrets.baseline
```

`.secrets.baseline` contains all the string that were caught by detect-secrets but are not stored in plain text. Audit the baseline to view the secrets . 

```
detect-secrets audit .secrets.baseline
```
